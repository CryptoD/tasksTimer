# Timer Persistence Fix Summary

## Problem
Timers would stop counting when the desktop restarts or the computer reboots. Users expected timers to continue from where they left off, like a real timer that keeps running even when you're not looking at it.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the timer restoration logic in `tasksTimer@CryptoD/timers.js`:

1. **Missing `run_states` getter**: The code tried to access `this.settings.run_states` but this property didn't exist in the Settings class.
2. **Wrong method name**: The code called `this.find_by_id()` but the actual method was `this.lookup()`.
3. **Incomplete restoration**: Restored timers weren't properly setting up session inhibitors and volume monitoring.
4. **Poor expired timer handling**: Timers that expired during downtime weren't showing proper notifications.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added `run_states` getter in `settings.js`
```javascript
get run_states() {
  try {
    const runningJson = this.settings.get_string('running');
    if (!runningJson || runningJson === '[]') {
      return [];
    }
    return JSON.parse(runningJson);
  } catch (e) {
    this.logger.warning('Failed to parse running timers JSON: %s', e.message);
    return [];
  }
}
```

### 2. Fixed method name in `restoreRunningTimers()`
Changed `this.find_by_id(run_state.id)` to `this.lookup(run_state.id)`

### 3. Added complete timer restoration
- **Session inhibitor**: Added `timersInstance.inhibitor.inhibit_timer(timer)` for restored timers
- **Volume monitoring**: Added volume level monitoring setup for restored timers
- **Volume warning state**: Properly initialized volume warning state

### 4. Improved expired timer notifications
When timers expire during downtime, they now:
- Show proper "late" notifications with time difference
- Set correct timer state (`TimerState.EXPIRED`)
- Log detailed information about how late the timer was

## How It Works Now

1. **Timer starts**: When a timer starts, its state (start time, end time, ID) is saved to both:
   - GSettings `running` key (JSON string)
   - Local storage file `timers.json`

2. **System restart**: When the extension loads after restart:
   - `refresh()` method calls `restoreRunningTimers()`
   - `run_states` getter parses the saved JSON data
   - For each saved timer, the system checks if it should still be running

3. **Timer restoration**: If timer should still be running:
   - Restores original start/end times
   - Calculates remaining time
   - Restarts the interval callback
   - Sets up session inhibitor
   - Sets up volume monitoring
   - Timer continues counting down from where it left off

4. **Expired timer handling**: If timer expired during downtime:
   - Shows "late" notification with time difference
   - Sets timer to expired state
   - Logs the expiration details

## Testing
Use the provided `test_timer_persistence.sh` script to verify the fix works:

1. Start a timer (e.g., 5 minutes)
2. Wait 1-2 minutes
3. Disable and re-enable the extension (simulates restart)
4. Verify timer continues from correct remaining time

## Files Modified
- `tasksTimer@CryptoD/settings.js`: Added `run_states` getter
- `tasksTimer@CryptoD/timers.js`: Fixed `restoreRunningTimers()` method

The fix ensures timers behave like real physical timers - they keep running even when you can't see them, and resume from the correct time when you check back.
